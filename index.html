						<p class="big">I graduated from the 
University of Kansas in 2006 with a Bachelor of Science in Journalism. As a student, I worked at Rock Chalk Video Productions and continued working there for seven years after I graduated.</p><br>
						
						<p class="big">Rock Chalk Video Productions is the video 
department within the athletic department for the University of Kansas. RCVP creates content and controls all video boards in Allen Fieldhouse, Memorial Stadium, Hoglund Ballpark, and Rock Chalk Park.  Rock Chalk Video Productions is responsible for all the electronic signage throughout the stadiums and Fieldhouse and creates the awesome atmosphere at football and basketball games.  Overall RCVP produces over 100 live events a year.</p><br>
				
						<p class="big">My other interests 
include photography and graphic design. I especially enjoyed photographing this year's solar eclipse in the path of totality.</p><br>

						<p class="big">While I'm interested 
in video production, photography and graphic design; I am excited to jump into the field of computer programming.</p><br>
